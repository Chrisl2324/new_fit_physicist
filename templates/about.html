            <h3>How it Began</h3>
            <hr class="hr hr-blurry" />
            <p>My fitness journey began at a young age. I grew up playing soccer and was intially interested just
                for the sheer enjoyment of playing a game with friends and getting a good workout. As i got older, 
                this enjoyment turned to passion when I became interested in weightlifting in high school. Things eventually
                turned more serious, and I dove head-first into educating myself about nutrition and different workout programs
                to achieve the best results. My love of weightlifting remains to this day, but life's twists and turns
                brought me to discover another fitness arena; calistenics
            </p>
            <h3>Life Happens</h3>
            <hr class="hr hr-blurry" />
            <p>In my twenties, I became addicted to drugs and lost all hope for future success and happiness.
                Eventually, I ended up in prison where I was powerless to change my situation and therefore was forced, instead, to
                change myself. I mention this for a reason: Life happens. I created this website, to share not only my
                experience with fitness and wellness, but to motivate others to pursue self-improvement and to be an example
                for anyone going through a struggle in his or her life. Change can and does happen, when hard work is put in!
